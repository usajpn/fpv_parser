# FPV Parser

## Step 1
Put the video files in the `input_video` folder.
The videos inside the folder will be merged and the audio will be erased.

## Step 2
Execute `fpv_parser.sh`
This creates a new `video_list.txt` which is the list of all files in the `input_video` folder.
After creating the file, the merging and the erasing of audio will be executed.
